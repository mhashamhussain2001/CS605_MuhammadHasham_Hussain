# Binary Search Tree (BST) Implementation

This project implements a **Binary Search Tree (BST)** in Python.  
Each node in the tree stores a **name** (as a key) and a **phone number** (as a value).  
The program supports inserting, searching, deleting, and sorting the tree using inorder traversal and displaying it in that way.


## Features

- **Insert:** Add a new nameâ€“phone pair to the tree.  
- **Search:** Seach a phone number by name.  
- **Delete:** Remove a record from the tree by name.  
- **Inorder Traversal:** Print all names and numbers in sorted (alphabetical) order.  


## How to Use

1. Open the file in an appropriate Python environment.  
2. Run the script.  
3. See the sample test cases as output to see how the tree behaves.
