# Simple Calculator (BST) Implementation

This project implements a **Binary Search Tree (BST)** in Python.  
Each node in the tree stores a **name** (as a key) and a **phone number** (as a value).  
The program supports inserting, searching, deleting, and displaying all records in sorted order.


## Features

- **Insert:** Add a new nameâ€“phone pair to the tree.  
- **Search:** Look up a phone number by name.  
- **Delete:** Remove a record from the tree by name.  
- **Inorder Traversal:** Print all names and numbers in sorted (alphabetical) order.  


## How to Use

1. Open the file in an appropriate Python environment (e.g., Jupyter Lab, VS Code, or terminal).  
2. Run the script.  
3. Observe the sample test cases at the bottom of the file to see how the tree behaves.  
4. You can add or modify records by editing the `insert`, `search`, or `delete` calls.
